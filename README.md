# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

In the future, I would like to include additional field sets to allow for a text input in the reservation section so that users are about to put additional information for special occasions they may be celebrating, like birthdays or anniversaries, etc.

Also, I believe adding pictures of the menu food items would add a realistic visualization for consumers to establish what they would like to purchase prior to their arrival to the shop, as well as increase sales for the coffee shop.
